I have been getting into chip level programming recently and wanted to get my hands dirty by trying to implement my own very basic CLI operating system in C and x86_64 assembly.

## Description

This is a simple custom operating system that is crudely named "egeOS"

### Progress

Right now, the kernel is somewhat written and you can emulate the OS by using the kernel.iso file located in this repo. The only thing it actually does is to display 'OK' as the system boots.

### TODO

I will be switching to 64 bit mode from the current 32 bit mode and I'll be writing some C code to implement a "print" function so that anything can be printed on the screen.
